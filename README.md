# TILE: Today I'm Learning Ethereum
Do you want to build useful [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) smart contracts and decentralized applications, but don't have much (or any) formal coding or programming experience? Me too. Fortunately, programmers tend to be willing to share their knowledge with the [community](https://stackexchange.com/ethereum) and we can subsequently benefit from those contributions to make our journey more efficient and rewarding. So where (and when) do we start? I think the best method for understanding a technology and gaining proficiency in its use is to *learn by doing*. This TILE Project, which stands for "Today I'm Learning Ethereum", is my attempt to learn more about Ethereum smart contracts by building actual decentralized applications on the Ethereum platform. Along the way I'll gather and share useful guides, information, tips, tricks, and code for those of you who want to participate or follow-along. When does this start? Preferably yesterday, or months ago, but I'll settle for today.



# Resources
[Lots to be filled in here. This is a work in progress]

## Ethereum Basics
Background information that one should read.

* [Ethereum White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper). Read the main article that clearly describes the scope and purpose of Ethereum. It's a bit technical, but not overly so. It think it's best to start at the original source, but it's too much too fast then the next couple of articles below provide a excellent overviews of Ethereum.

* [Understanding Ethereum: Bitcoin's Virtual Cousin](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/technology/what-is-ethereum.html)

[Balaji S. Srinivasan' "Thoughts on Tokens"](https://news.21.co/thoughts-on-tokens-436109aabcbe):

#### Ether Wallets (some have solidity compiler integration)

* [Mist -- Ethereum Wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases): Use this if you want to create an ether wallet and start using Ether, trade tokens, watch tokens, or watch contracts. It's build by the Ethereum Foundation, and is in a constant state of improvement and development.
* [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/): An in-browser wallet generator
* [Ethers.io](https://ethers.io): An in-browser wallet with a solidity code compiler; it's also adding support for applications (dApps)
* [Metamask.io](https://metamask.io): A chrome extension ethereum wallet with a good user interface. Useful in conjunction with Browser Solidity to inject contracts into the blockchain.





#### IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and Code Editors

This is a list of tools that you can use for writing Ethereum smart contracts.

#### Advice
[Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)(Creator of Stack Exchange), from ITworld [article](http://www.itworld.com/article/2932599/enterprise-software/the-importance-of-coding-buddies-and-other-advice-for-programmers.html). See his [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerchat/comments/38pggs/i_am_jeff_atwood_long_time_blogger_at/) as well:
> 1. **Learn by Doing** real projects. "Build stuff. In the process of building something, if you need a new tool, learn it then"
> 2. **Aim to be dumbest person in the room**
> 3. **Have a coding buddy**

Adding to that, we should include:

> 4. **Start as soon as you can**. Start yesterday. This reminds of another good article on the [important habit of just starting](https://lifehacker.com/the-important-habit-of-just-starting-1771016698)

* [Don't Call yourself a programmer](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) -- Kalzumeus
